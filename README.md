# Hyper Typer
An iOS typing game that tests a player's typing skills with a variety of texts originating from different genres. The player's typing performance is tracked throughout their entire play time in order to analyse their overall improvement over time.

# Purpose
Hyper Typer was made as a learner project for iOS development and Swift. The goal was to learn the basic development process of an iOS app. This includes the usage of Storyboards for building responsive UIs and the integration of CocoaPods to manage external dependencies.

# Where Can I Download?
The app is yet to be published on the Apple App Store. There are a few list of features that need to be implemented in order for the app to be in a production-ready state. 

# What's Left To Do?
The app lacks a database integration to store user data on the cloud. Currently, the user's data is stored within Core Data. This means that each user only plays in an offline manner and cannot see the statistics of others. I will publish the app when such database is integrated. I will work on project at a later time to add this last key feature.
