# Purpose
This app was made as a learner project for iOS and Swift. The goal was to learn the basic development process of an iOS app. This includes the usage of Storyboards and the integrations of CocoaPods.

# Where Can I Download?
No intentions were ever made to publisht this app to the Apple App Store. I don't feel like the app meets my personal requirements to be published. I may still come back later and add new features that would meet my requirements and possibly publish it to the App Store.
